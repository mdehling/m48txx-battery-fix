The M48T02/M48T08 NVRAM chips have builtin batteries and these batteries die
after a couple of years, resulting in the loss of the NVRAM contents.  As a
result, depending on the system in question, the NVRAM may need to be
reprogrammed on every boot.  This module is designed to replace the top half
of the NVRAM chip containing the battery to make it easily replaceable.  The
project is a shameless ripoff of GlitchWorks'.  You can buy their version for
the {url-tindie-gw48t02}[M48T02] and {url-tindie-gw48t08}[M48T08] on Tindie,
and they have more.

By using SMT components, an M48TXX rebuilt with this module is, in fact,
flatter than the original.  Do note, however, that, with a CR2016 installed
the chip is a little wider than before.  Make sure this is not a problem in
your system!


Parts & Assembly
----------------
Besides the battery, the upper half of the M48TXX also contains a 32.768kHz
Crystal.  These are the replacement parts I use:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Designator | Quantity | Description

| Y1         | 1        | ECS-.327-12.5-34QCN-TR
| BT1        | 1        | Linx BAT-HLD-002-SMT
|===

The battery holder is a CR2016 coin cell holder, so obviously you will also
need a CR2016 coin cell to install in it.

Once you assemble the board, it should look something like this:

Rebuilding the Chip
-------------------
Read link:{url-gw-48t02}[GlitchWorks' post on the M48T02].  Make sure to
correctly align pin 1, both when rebuilding the NVRAM and when installing it,
or you *will* kill your NVRAM.

Here are some photos of the rebuilt module installed in a SPARCstation IPC:

Reprogramming the NVRAM
-----------------------
How to do this depends on the machine the chip is used in.  For SUN's
SPARCstations see the {url-nvram-faq}[NVRAM FAQ].
